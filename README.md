Had issues to copy right one API (first time copied from 5 Day/ 3hour Forecast instead of One Call API). All parameters took from wrong one but TA helped me to figure it out. Green check box - is correct resourse, pink - which I took fir the first time

 Also, the icon and parameters weren't show up on the header - because took doc.parameters from wrong table (didn't know that we can take it from console - so helpful). 

 We can not use Bootstrap in our Project1 but for HW I took it from example from activities (in Project1 we use Foundation).
