Had issues to copy right one API (first time copied from 5 Day/ 3hour Forecast instead of One Call API). All parameters took from wrong one but TA helped me to figure it out.

 Also, the icon and parameters weren't show up on the header - because took doc.parameters from wrong table (didn't know that we can take it from console - so helpful). 

 We can not use Bootstrap in our Project1 but for HW I took it from example from activities (in Project1 we use Foundation).
